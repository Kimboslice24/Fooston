All Players and organizers must follow this rulebook.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    The rulebook is meant as a guide to assist the Referees. Its goal is above all to explain the rules of the game. And so, as much as the Referee’s goal is to show his authority for the good of the game, he must also be careful not to slow it down by a too strict arbitration.
  </li>
  <li>
    Reminder: Federation Referees represent the highest authority of the rulebook in a tournament. Their decisions must be respected and cannot be disputed. A Federation Referee can be called upon to advise on interpretations of the rulebook. If no Federation Referee is present at the tournament, the Tournament Director assumes the duties of a Federation Referee.
  </li>
  <li>
    The rules of the game of table soccer are conceived as much to facilitate ruling by Referees as by the Players themselves.
  </li>
  <li>
    The objective is to limit subjective interpretations to an absolute minimum.
  </li>
  <li>
    The aim of the rules is also to bring the game to a level of mutual respect between the Players while seeming transparent to the spectators.
  </li>
  <li>
    We remind the reader that while the Referee’s judgment cannot be challenged, human errors can be a part of the game.
  </li>
</ol>

Any action of an unsportsmanlike or unethical nature during tournament play, in the tournament room, or on the grounds of the
host facility, will be considered a violation of the Code of Ethics. Mutual respect between all players, Referees and/or
spectators is a requirement. It shall be the aim of every player and Referee to represent table-soccer in the most positive and
sportsmanlike manner possible.

## 1.1

The penalty for breaking the Code of Ethics may be forfeiture of a game or match, expulsion from the tournament, and/or a fine. Whether or not the Code of Ethics has been broken, and what is the appropriate penalty for the infraction will be determined by the ITSF Disciplinary Commission or if not present by the Head Official and Tournament Director.

A ball entering the goal shall count as a point, as long as it was legally scored. A ball which enters the goal but returns to the
playing surface and/or leaves the table still counts as a goal.

## 12.1

If a point is not counted on the scoring markers and both teams agree that it was previously scored and inadvertently not marked up, the point shall count. If both teams do not agree that a point was scored and not marked up that point shall not be counted. Once the next game (or match) has begun no appeal can be made and the point shall not count.

## 12.2

If there is a controversy over whether or not the ball entered the goal, a Referee should be called to make a ruling. The Referee may make a ruling based on information received by the players and/or spectators. If the information gathered is inconclusive the point shall not count.

## 12.3

Any team intentionally marking up a point not scored shall not get credit for the point illegally marked up and shall be charged with a technical foul. Further violations of this rule will be grounds for forfeiture of game or match (to be determined by the Head Official).

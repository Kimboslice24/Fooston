Once a match has been called, both teams should report immediately to the designated table. If a team has not reported to the table within three minutes, they should be recalled. A team, upon being recalled, must report immediately to the table in order to stop the forfeiture process.

## 26.1

A recall is made every three minutes. Penalty for third and subsequent recalls is forfeiture of each game until the match is over.
  
## 26.2

If a team has forfeited any games due to recalls, they get the choice of side or serve once play begins.

## 26.3

Enforcement of this rule is the responsibility of the Tournament Director.

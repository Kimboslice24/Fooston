Possession of the ball shall be limited to 10 seconds on the five-man rod and 15 seconds on all other rods. A player is considered to be in possession of the ball the moment it is within reach of a player figure. Both goalie rods are considered one rod of possession.

## 24.1

A ball is considered to have advanced once it leaves the current rod of possession whether it goes forward or backwards. In the goalie area, the ball is considered advanced once out of reach of the two-man rod or inside the goal.

## 24.2

A spinning ball that is within reach of a player figure shall be considered in that rod's possession and all time limits shall continue, however, if the spinning ball is not within reach, the time limits are not in effect. ([See Rule 8.3](/foosball-rules/dead-ball#8-3))

## 24.3

Penalty - penalty for three-man delay is loss of possession to the opposing goalie. Penalty for delay at any other rod is loss of possession to the opposing forward for serve.

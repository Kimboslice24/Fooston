After each game is completed, teams have a 90 second time limit to begin the next game. If teams agree to switch sides of the
table after the first game, they must continue to switch sides between games for the remainder of the match. If the teams decide
not to switch sides after the first game, they must stay on the same sides for the remainder of the match.

## 13.1

If both teams wish to resume play before the full time has elapsed, play shall continue and the remainder of the 90 seconds is then forfeited.

## 13.2

If a team, is not ready to play at the end of the 90 second period, that team shall be charged with delay of game. (See Rule 25)

## 13.3

The Tournament Organizer may require teams to remain on the same sides during televised or recorded matches.

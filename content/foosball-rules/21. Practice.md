Practice shall be permitted on any table before the match begins and between games. Once a game has begun, practice shall not be permitted.

## 20.1

Practice is defined as moving the ball from one player figure to another or shooting the ball.

### 20.1.1

Illegal Practice is a judgment call by the Referee at the table. Inadvertent movement of the ball, or using the player figures to position the ball before the serve, does not constitute practice.

## 20.2

The Penalty for illegal practice is a loss of possession to the opposing team for serve. If the player does not have possession he will be issued a warning. Subsequent violations will be a technical foul.

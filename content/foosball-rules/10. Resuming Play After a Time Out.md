Following a time out, the ball shall be put back into play at the rod of possession where the time out was called.

## 10.1

The Ready Protocol must be followed when resuming play following a time out. ([See Rule 4.2](/foosball-rules/serve-and-ready-protocol#4-2-ready-protocol))

### 10.1.1
    
As soon as the player in possession puts his hands back on the handles, if the ball leaves the current rod before the procedure of putting the ball back into play has begun, the opponent has the choice to continue play from the current position or to serve the ball.

## 10.2

If the ball was not in play when the time out was called, the ball shall be put back into play by the team legally entitled to do so according to the rules.

### 10.2.1

If the time-out was called between balls (after a goal is scored but before the next ball is served) the ball shall be served on the 5-rod by the team which was last scored upon.

## 10.3

The penalty for illegally putting the ball back into play is the opponent's choice to continue play from the current position or serve the ball.

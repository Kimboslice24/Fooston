      <description>This release brings a choice of AP Style or Chicago Style Title Case (8fb594bf #989). You can also now configure Blackfriday to render « French Guillemets » (cb9dfc26 #3725). To enable French Guillemets, put this in your site config.toml:
[blackfriday] angledQuotes = true smartypantsQuotesNBSP = true Oh, and this release also fixes it so you should see no ugly long crashes no more when you step wrong in your templates (794ea21e).</description>

      <description>Netlify recently announced support for HTTP/2 server push, and we have now added it to the gohugo.io sites for the main CSS and JS bundles, along with server-side 301 redirect support.
If you navigate to https://gohugo.io and look in the Chrome developer network console, you should now see Push as the new source (&amp;ldquo;Initiator&amp;rdquo;) for the CSS and JSS:

      <description> This is a bug-fix release with a couple of important fixes.
Hugo now has:

      <description>Hugo 0.25 is the Kinder Surprise: It automatically opens the page you&amp;#39;re working on in the browser, it adds full AND and OR support in page queries, and you can now have templates per language.
If you start with hugo server --navigateToChanged, Hugo will navigate to the relevant page on save (see animated GIF). This is extremely useful for site-wide edits. Another very useful feature in this version is the added support for AND (intersect) and OR (union) filters when combined with where.</description>

      <description> This release fixes some important archetype-related regressions from the recent Hugo 0.24-release.
Fixes  Fix archetype regression when no archetype file 4294dd8d @bep #3626 Preserve shortcodes in archetype templates b63e4ee1 @bep #3623 Fix handling of timezones with positive UTC offset (e.g., +0800) in TOML 0744f81e @bep #3628  Enhancements  Create default archetype on new site bfa336d9 @bep #3626  </description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A feature that could be the name of the next Indiana Jones movie deserves its own release,&amp;rdquo; says &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bep&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;@bep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugo now handles the &lt;strong&gt;archetype files as Go templates&lt;/strong&gt;. This means that the issues with sorting and lost comments are long gone. This also means that you will have to supply all values, including title and date. But this also opens up a lot of new windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fictional example for the section &lt;code&gt;newsletter&lt;/code&gt; and the archetype file &lt;code&gt;archetypes/newsletter.md&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;---
title: &amp;quot;{{ replace .TranslationBaseName &amp;quot;-&amp;quot; &amp;quot; &amp;quot; | title }}&amp;quot;
date: {{ .Date }}
draft: true

**Insert Lead paragraph here.**

{{ range first 10 ( where .Site.RegularPages &amp;quot;Type&amp;quot; &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot; ) }}
* {{ .Title }}

      <description>Hugo 0.23 is mainly a release that handles all the small changes needed to get Hugo moved to a GitHub organisation: gohugoio, but it also contains a couple of important fixes that makes this an update worth-while for all.
Hugo now has:

      <description>Hugo 0.22.1 fixes a couple of issues reported after the 0.22 release Monday. Most importantly a fix for detecting regular subfolders below the root-sections.
Also, we forgot to adapt the permalink settings with support for nested sections, which made that feature less useful than it could be.
With this release you can configure permalinks with sections like this:
First level only:
[permalinks] blog = &amp;quot;:section/:title&amp;quot;  Nested (all levels):</description>

      <description>Hugo 0.22 brings nested sections, by popular demand and a long sought after feature (#465). We are still low on documentation for this great feature, but @bep has been kind enough to accompany his implementation with a demo site.
This release represents 58 contributions by 10 contributors to the main Hugo code base. Since last release Hugo has gained 420 stars and 2 additional themes.
@bep still leads the Hugo development with his witty Norwegian humor, and once again contributed a significant amount of additions.</description>

      <description>Hugo 0.21 brings full support for shortcodes per Output Format (#3220), the last vital piece of that puzzle. This is especially useful for Google AMP with its many custom media tags.
This release represents 126 contributions by 29 contributors to the main Hugo code base. Since last main release Hugo has gained 850 stars and 7 additional themes.
Hugo now has:
 17156&amp;#43; stars 457&amp;#43; contributors 163&amp;#43; themes  @bep leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to @moorereason, @bogem, and @munnerz for their ongoing contributions.</description>

      <description>Hugo 0.20.2 adds support for plain text partials included into HTML templates. This was a side-effect of the big new Custom Output Format feature in 0.20, and while the change was intentional and there was an ongoing discussion about fixing it in #3273, it did break some themes. There were valid workarounds for these themes, but we might as well get it right.
The most obvious use case for this is inline CSS styles, which you now can do without having to name your partials with a html suffix.</description>

      <description>Hugo 0.20 introduces the powerful and long sought after feature Custom Output Formats; Hugo isn’t just that “static HTML with an added RSS feed” anymore. Say hello to calendars, e-book formats, Google AMP, and JSON search indexes, to name a few ( #2828 ).

      <guid>https://fooston.com/news/0-17/</guid>
      <description>Hugo is going global with our 0.17 release. We put a lot of thought into how we could extend Hugo to support multilingual websites with the most simple and elegant experience. Hugo&amp;rsquo;s multilingual capabilities rival the best web and documentation software, but Hugo&amp;rsquo;s experience is unmatched. If you have a single language website, the simple Hugo experience you already love is unchanged. Adding additional languages to your website is simple and straightforward.</description>

      <description>An Official Time Out does not count towards the two time outs allowed per team per game. After an Official Time Out, the ball is put back into play as though a regular Time Out was called.
11.1 If a Referee is not present at the start of the match, and a dispute arises during play, either team may request a Referee. Such a request can be made at any point during the match that the ball is stopped or dead.</description>

      <description>All Players and organizers must follow this rulebook.
 The rulebook is meant as a guide to assist the Referees. Its goal is above all to explain the rules of the game. And so, as much as the Referee’s goal is to show his authority for the good of the game, he must also be careful not to slow it down by a too strict arbitration.   Reminder: Federation Referees represent the highest authority of the rulebook in a tournament.</description>

      <description>official ruleset
This latest revision of the ITSF Rule Book is the culmination of a collaborative effort with input from many players and referees from around the world under the direction of the ITSF Rules Commission. Changes have been made to simplify some rules, to clarify others, and to make it easier for referees to officiate matches. Players are encouraged to learn and study these rules so that, regardless of one’s nationality or table preference, all may compete fairly according to the same standards of play.</description>

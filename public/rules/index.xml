      <description>All Players and organizers must follow this rulebook.
 The rulebook is meant as a guide to assist the Referees. Its goal is above all to explain the rules of the game. And so, as much as the Referee’s goal is to show his authority for the good of the game, he must also be careful not to slow it down by a too strict arbitration.   Reminder: Federation Referees represent the highest authority of the rulebook in a tournament.</description>
